# Tableau Data Analysis Project (Beginner Level)

This project contains a Tableau-based data analysis project that I developed as part of my learning journey with Tableau. The project was completed after following a tutorial, and it serves as a beginner-level exercise to explore data visualization and analytical techniques in Tableau.

## Project Overview
In this project, I practiced several foundational Tableau skills, including:
- Data import and connection
- Building interactive visualizations
- Creating dashboards for comprehensive data presentation
- Applying basic analysis techniques to derive insights from the data

The project was designed to build my proficiency in Tableau and familiarize myself with the platform's core features, with a focus on data exploration and presentation.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the tutorial **[Tableau for Beginners by Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOR0-nygfDE&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=32&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst)**, which served as the basis for learning key concepts and techniques in Tableau.
